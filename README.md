# bonneted_bat_occupancy
This is a project to estimate occupancy from ultrasonic acoustic recordings of the Florida bonneted bat (Eumops floridanus; EUFL) on the Avon Park Air Force Range near Sebring, FL. There are 498 randomly-selected deployment locations throughout the APAFR that were allowed to run from 3-20 nights during 2019-2020.
Project collaborators are Rob Schorr (Colorado State University), Rob Aldredge (USFWS), Kris Pitcher (USFWS), and Paul Lukacs (University of Montana)
